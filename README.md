# Have a nice day [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pedrovgs/HaveANiceDay.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pedrovgs/HaveANiceDay)

Server-side code for ``Have a nice day`` project written in [Scala](https://scala-lang.org) using [Finatra](https://twitter.github.io/finatra/).

## Run the project

This repository uses [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) as build tool. To run this project you can just import this repository as an Play or SBT project into your IDE or run the following command:

```
sbt run
```

This will download some dependencies needed to build and run the project and will start listening for HTTP requests on ``localhost:9000``.

## Pass the tests

To build and test this project you can execute ``sbt test``. You can also use sbt interactive mode (you just have to execute ``sbt`` in your terminal) and then use the triggered execution to execute your tests using the following commands inside the interactive mode:

```
~ test // Runs every test in your project
~ test-only *AnySpec // Runs specs matching with the filter passed as param.
```

You can review the current project coverage by executing: 

```
sbt coverage test 
sbt coverageReport
```

## Checkstyle

For the project checkstyle we are using [ScalaFMT](http://scalameta.org/scalafmt/). The code format will be evaluated after accepting any contribution to this repository using this tool. You can easily format your code changes automatically by executing ``sbt format``.

## API documentation

The REST API created in this project is documented using [Swagger](https://swagger.io/). In the repository root folder you can find a [swagger.yaml](./swagger.yaml) file you can open with your favorite Swagger editor and use it to review the documentation or for debugging purposes. **This file can be also used to generate client side code in many different languages automatically using [Swagger Code Gen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen).** You can easily install Swagger Code Gen from brew and execute the following command to generate, for example, the iOS API Client code:
   
```
swagger-codegen generate -i target/swagger/swagger.json -l swift -o ~/Desktop/zolla-ios-api-client
``` 

## Slick DB framework

This project uses [Slick](http://slick.lightbend.com/) to be able to handle DB queries in a functional an easy way. We've configured [slick-codegen](http://slick.lightbend.com/doc/3.2.1/code-generation.html) to generate the FRM code automatically using the DB schema. Todo this you only need to execute ``sbt slickCodeGen`` once the local DB schema is up to date. This will generate a file named ``src/main/scala/slick/Tables.scala`` where you can find all the definition for the tables and the rows used inside.   

## Docker

Inside ``docker`` folder you'll find all the images and utils to run Have a nice day locally using [Docker](https://docker.com) by just executing the following command. Remember to start docker before running your app.

```
 docker-compose up -d
```

This will download pre-builded images and download dependencies in order to build local images.

## DB Migrations

This project handles DB migrations using [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org). All the DB migrations can be found in ``src/main/resources/db/migration``. Remember that migrations won't be applied automatically. In order to run a migration in your local environment you can execute ``sbt flywayMigrate``. If the migration has to be performed in the production server you'll need to connect to the DB instance using ``flyway`` CLI and execute the following command:

```
flyway -user=<REDACTED> -password=<REDACTED> -url=jdbc:mysql://<REDACTED> -locations=filesystem:src/main/resources/db/migration migrate
```

Or if you are working on your laptop you can directly use the following sbt commands:

```
//Validate database migration
sbt flywayValidate
//Clean database and schema
sbt flywayClean
//Apply migrations locally
sbt flywayMigrate
//Repair database if something has changed in old migrations and the changes are still valid
sbt flywayRepair
//Prints the details and status information about all the migrations
sbt flywayInfo
```

## Configuration

This project can be configured using different values such as the Firebase configuration API key or the Twitter Credentials configuration. In order to override the default configuration you can replace the values found inside the ``*.conf`` files or use environment variables. If you define the following environment variables the project will be configured properly:

```
export MYSQL_JDBC_URL="YOUR_MYSQL_SERVER_URL"
export MYSQL_USER="YOUR_MYSQL_USER"
export MYSQL_PASSWORD="YOUR_MYSQL_PASSWORD"
export FIREBASE_API_KEY="YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY"
export FIREBASE_DEFAULT_TOPIC="FIREBASE_DEFAULT_TOPIC_USED_BY_THE_APP"
export TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY="YOUR_TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY"
export TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET="YOUR_TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET"
export TWITTER_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_TWITTER_ACCESS_KEY"
export TWITTER_ACCESS_SECRET="YOUR_TWITTER_ACCESS_SECRET"
export SCHEDULE_SMILE_TASKS=true
export SMILES_EXTRACTION_SCHEDULE="0 0 8 ? * *"
export SMILES_GENERATION_SCHEDULE="0 0 9 ? * *"
``` 

## Docker image

This project is ready to automatically create a docker image you can easily deploy on any server. You just need to execute:

```
sbt assembly
docker build -t haveaniceday .
```

If you need to run this image from command line you can execute:

```
docker run haveaniceday -d
```

If you need to generate a tar file with the docker image you can execute:

```
docker save IMAGE_TAG > haveaniceday.tar
```

Or upload the image to docker hub executing the following commands:

```
docker images
docker tag DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG YOUR_DOCKER_USERNAME/haveaniceday:latest
docker login --username=YOUR_DOCKER_USERNAME
docker push YOUR_DOCKER_USERNAME/haveaniceday
```
